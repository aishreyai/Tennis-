<h1> My Tennis Experience </h1>
Being on Whitney's tennis team for three years has been a fantastic experience that has taught me a lot. As the captain of the JV team, it has taught me leadership skills as well as the value of effective communication in inspiring and managing a varied group of players toward a shared goal. I've learned about strategy and sportsmanship, and I've improved my ability to assess opponents and modify my tactics on the court. It has also taught me the importance of time management, and perseverance, both in athletics and in life. Overall, my experience with the tennis team has made me into a more confident, determined, and team-oriented person.
